intro:
    heading: "What is Catholic Heritage?"
    text: "Historical sites can be important to Catholic heritage because they often have connections to important events or people in the history of the Catholic Church.
For example, a church that was built hundreds of years ago may have been visited by a saint or have been the site of an important religious event.
Catholic cathedrals and other religious buildings are also considered historical sites that are important to the Catholic heritage.
These sites may have art and artifacts that tell the story of the Catholic faith and its history.
Visiting these historical sites can help Catholics learn more about their heritage and feel connected to their faith."

    heading: Our values
    text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.

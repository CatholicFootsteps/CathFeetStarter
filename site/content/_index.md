intro:
    heading: "Why Focus on Catholic Heritage Sites?"
    text: "Catholic heritage sites are important because they often have connections to important events or people in the history of the Catholic Church.
A hundreds years-old church may have been visited by a saint or have been the site of an important religious event.
Catholic cathedrals and other religious buildings also have art and artifacts that tell the story of the Catholic faith, its history, and its diverse communities.
Visiting these historical sites help Catholic students learn more about their heritage and feel connected to their faith."

    heading: Our values
    text: "Make a Pilgrimage: To facilitate spiritual journeys, to historical sites that are important to our Catholic faith. These trips are a way to deepen one's faith and connect with the spiritual history of the Church.

Foster Respect for Historical Sites and Artifacts: Cultivate an appreciation for the preservation and respect of historical sites and artifacts that are important to our Catholic faith, such as churches, cathedrals, and religious artwork - because of their historical and spiritual significance.

Encounter Different Cultures: Catholic heritage and history is not limited to one country or culture, it is a global heritage. We recognize that the Catholic faith has been lived out in many different ways throughout history and that by understanding and appreciating different cultural expressions of the faith, we can deepen our own understanding of our Catholic faith."
